# Maximal-Weighted-Independent-Set

A. centralized program to implement GWMIN

B. distributed algorithm to implement GWMIN

MWIS termed GWMIN prioritizes node v that has the maximal W(v) / (deg(v)+ 1) value among all candidates,

where W(v) is the weight associated with v and deg(v) is the node degree of v.
